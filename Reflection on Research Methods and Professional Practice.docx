Introduction
In this reflection, I will critically examine my learning journey throughout the Research Methods and Professional Practice module, undertaken in April 2024. This reflection will address the critical incidents that shaped my understanding of research methods, statistical analysis, and professional skills development. It will also evaluate my performance in completing module tasks, including the required statistics exercises, and reflect on how this module has contributed to my growth as both a researcher and professional. Finally, I will outline how this learning experience will inform my future work in the computing field.
WHAT: Project Outcomes and Learning
Throughout the module, I engaged in a variety of activities designed to enhance my understanding of research methods, ethics, and statistical analysis. The following areas were key learning outcomes:
•	Research Ethics: The introduction to research methods in Unit 1 emphasized important ethical considerations in computing research, such as data privacy, informed consent, and the avoidance of bias in research designs (Babbie, 2020). Understanding these principles is essential for ensuring the integrity and credibility of research findings.
•	Literature Review and Research Proposal: Units 2 and 3 emphasized academic investigation and research design, teaching me to critically evaluate literature and identify gaps. This process enhanced my ability to formulate focused research questions and develop sound research proposals(Creswell, 2018).
•	Statistical Analysis: Units 6 and 7 introduced descriptive and inferential statistics. Completing several exercises that required applying these statistical methods to analyze research data strengthened my capacity to use statistics to support research findings (Field, 2017). This practical experience helped demystify complex statistical concepts, making them more accessible for real-world applications.
•	Professional Skills Development: Completing a professional skills matrix and SWOT analysis helped me identify my strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, enabling me to set specific personal and professional growth goals (Kolb, 1984).
SO WHAT: Analyzing the Learning Experience
Reflecting on the tasks I completed throughout this module, it is evident that I gained a deeper understanding of the role of research in the computing field and its impact on professional practice.
•	Critical Evaluation of Literature: I initially underestimated the complexity of a thorough literature review. Through exercises, I learned to synthesize research and refine my questions to address real-world issues, enhancing my ability to contribute meaningfully to the field.(Creswell, 2018).
•	Research Methodology Challenges: One of the challenges I faced was designing a valid research methodology that could be generalized to a wider audience. The exercises on validity and generalizability (Unit 9) were particularly useful in helping me address this issue (Saunders M. L., 2019). By recognizing the importance of sound methodology, I now feel more equipped to tackle similar challenges in future research endeavors.
•	Statistics Exercises: Working through the statistical exercises in Units 7 and 8, especially on inferential statistics and hypothesis testing, was enlightening. Although I initially struggled with applying statistical formulas to real data, the worksheets and practical applications significantly improved my analytical skills(Field, 2017). 
•	Action Plan and Professional Growth: The professional skills matrix and SWOT analysis offered a structured way to assess my development. By identifying strengths like problem-solving and weaknesses such as time management, I was able to prioritize areas for improvement (Rolfe, 2001). This self-assessment process has empowered me to take actionable steps toward my career goals.
NOW WHAT: Applying the Learning to Future Work
The skills and knowledge I acquired from this module will profoundly shape my future endeavors.
•	Research and Analysis: Critically appraising research and producing sound proposals will be invaluable for my computing projects. I now feel confident in applying robust methodologies and statistical analysis to validate findings(Creswell, 2018), enhancing my contributions to my team and organization.
•	Professional Application: The insights gained about the ethical, social, and legal implications of research in computing will guide my professional practice. I am now more aware of the importance of data protection and ethical considerations, especially with sensitive information(Babbie, 2020). Adhering to ethical guidelines will enhance my professional reputation and the credibility of my work.
•	Action Plan for Continuous Improvement: I plan to use my SWOT analysis and professional skills matrix for ongoing development. My immediate step is to enroll in a time management course to improve this key weakness. Additionally, I will seek opportunities to apply my statistical skills by working on data analysis projects in my professional role.
•	Long-Term Goals: My long-term goal is to enhance my effectiveness as a researcher and professional in computing, with a focus on cybersecurity. The knowledge gained from this module on research methods, data analysis, and ethics will provide a strong foundation for this ambition. I aim to stay updated on industry developments and continually refine my skills to meet the evolving demands of the field.
Conclusion
In summary, the Research Methods and Professional Practice module has significantly shaped my understanding of research in computing. Covering ethical considerations and statistical analysis, each aspect has fostered my professional growth. This reflection process enabled me to critically assess my experiences and set clear goals for future improvement, ensuring my continuous development as a researcher and computing professional. I am optimistic about applying the skills and knowledge gained from this module to contribute meaningfully to the computing field and pursue a successful career in research and professional practice.
